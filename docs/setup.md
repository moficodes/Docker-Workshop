# Setup

## Install Docker

### Locally

If you want to create docker containers and get into the nitty gritty of docker it is recommended that you download and setup docker on your own machine. 

I have a whole playlist of docker stuff. First three videos talk about installing docker for your OS.

If instructions are what you prefer [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/) should give you the instruction you need.

### Cloud Shell

For using this method you would need a IBM Cloud Account. Create one here [https://ibm.biz/BdzgmW](https://ibm.biz/BdzgmW)

Then go to [shell.cloud.ibm.com](https://shell.cloud.ibm.com/)

### Docker Playground

There is also docker playground. I have not used this too much. So I can't guarantee how well it will work. But initial tests looked promising.

### Katacoda

You can also use Katacoda Docker Playground

## Test

Once you have yourself an environment time to test.

In the shell

```text
docker -v
```

 Anything over 18 is good.

## Clone the test Repo

Clone the repo 

```text
git clone https://github.com/moficodes/Docker-Workshop.git
```

```text
cd Docker-Workshop/app
```
